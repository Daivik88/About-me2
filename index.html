        <h1>Playing Cricket!</h1>
        <section id="pg1-2">
            <p id="cricket">I like Cricket because it is very fun to play as it is a 4-22 player game. There are 2 teams (even 3 (triseries)), one team has to feild/bowl and other team has to bat. it is simple, but very fun! By the way my favourite cricketer is Kirat Kohli. he is the captain of the indian cricket team and Royal Challengers Bangalore!! I Love Playing Cricket!... (but these days we play cricket rarely and insted, we play foot ball...)</p>
